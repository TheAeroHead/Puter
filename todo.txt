TODO:
	Order model (delivery progress, items, item quantities)
	Order view (translation of payment app to purchase an item added to the cart)
	*cart.html: Cart view fleshed out:
		-displays an order: a list of items to be purchased
		-Needs a pay now button that charges user for cost of items in cart (ignore shipping and tax costs for now)
		-should verify user address or ask to add a new address before pulling up stripe api
	cognitive walkthrough
	User model: custom user model or some work around to link addresses and orders to a specific user
	Sessions: website should not show different data based on whether user is logged in:
		-link cart to session information, we need to link cart to user for addresses and that requires a user to be logged in
	*Search filtering: Search results should have filters in sidebar that update what items are displayed
	*index.html: categories should be used for browsing
		-Clicking on a category square on the homepage should link to a list of all items in that category
		-try using ItemListView to display all categories (can link with the all categories link in temporary sidebar to test)
		-will need a modified solution to filter only results with a specific category (use category__icontains for filter option)
	Sidebar: sidebar is temporary functionality that should only appear on the search results page for filtering
		-not a priority, this is for making the page look nice and can be ignored for testing purposes
		-remove sidebar from unnecessary pages and properly position page using CSS
		-add filters with link to update search_result.html with relevant new filter for items
	database script: want a script to add 50 unique items with at least one item in each of the 8 categories to the database
	*add_item.html: work with products/views.py, products/forms.py, Puter/settings.py and Puter/urls.py to fix upload function
	*profile_info.html: needs to be fully fleshed out:
		-displays relevant user information like email, username and name
		-should display user shipping address
		-should have a link to order history (or display order history on page)
		-should have a button to edit address (address should be displayed as a form in html)

DONE:
	digital wireframes (use justinmind prototyper or even gliffy)
		scenarios
		flow charts
	*Contact.html form should link to a message that says the form was submitted
	Sessions:
		-allow access to profile information, else redirect to login
		-change login and signup links to username and order history, respectively
	*sign_up.html: create a signup page. Look for official django documentation, django has a built-in solution just like login.
	*product_detail.html: should not use a list to display (we want items to display horizontally and not vertically
		
	*FAQ.html needs to give tutorials for using certain elements:
		-logging in, 
		-adding items to cart, 
		-searching, 
		-viewing cart and paying
		-editing user information
		-signing up
		-contacting support
	CSS styling: mostly for positioning (colors and graphics are extra):
		-headers for base_generic.html are positioned weirdly and need some inline styling to make them appear on one row.
		-categories for homepage should be centered
