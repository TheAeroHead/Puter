# Puter
A shopping website for computer parts. Built with the Django Framework.

REQUIRED TOOLS: <br>
1. Installation of Python 3.7.2 or later. (should include sqlite3 and pip) <br>
2. Installation of Pip (likely installed with Python, if pip -V returns error run standalone installer) <br>
3. Installation of Pipenv (run pip install pipenv) <br>
4. Run pipenv shell before any pipenv install (else you won't install to the virtual environment) <br>
4. Installation of Django 2.1.5 or later. (run pipenv install django) <br>
5. Installation of PostgreSQL 11.2 or later. (use the enterpriseDB installer, will save a lot of setup headaches) <br>
6. Installation of pgAdmin4 (recommended and included in enterpriseDB installer) <br> 
7. Installation of psycopg2 package (run pipenv install psycopg2) <br>
8. Installation of Python library for Argon2 (run pipenv install django[argon2]) <br>
9. Installation of Stripe API (run pipenv install stripe) <br>
10. Installation of Pillow (run pipenv install pillow) <br>

DEVELOPMENT SETUP: <br>
1. Clone the repository to the computer. (need to install pipenv in repository directory) <br>
2. Installation of all above tools (recommended to follow above order) <br>
3. pipenv shell to initialize virtual environment within project folder. Removes need to type python in front of manage.py and helps ensure no conflicts between python versions (if multiple installed). <br>
4. pgAdmin4 to check contents of database from GUI <br>
5. Make sure that all commands are run after initializing virtual environment with pipenv shell or will throw issues when you runserver. <br>
6. After installing PostgreSQL, run pgAdmin4 and login (password setup during install). Create new superuser datadmin for development purposes (preset authentication with this user in settings.py). IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS, THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES!<br>
7. Create new database pUsers and give datadmin priviliges to use it if not already. <br>
8. Setup development server by running python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate <br>
9. Test app view by running python manage.py runserver <br>
10. Update development server by running python manage.py make migrations and python manage.py migrate
